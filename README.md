# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction Per Country

This is a machine learning web application that predicts crop yield (in tonnes/hectare) based on various agricultural and environmental inputs such as rainfall, pesticide usage, average temperature, crop type, and country.

Built with **Flask** for the backend, **Scikit-learn** for model prediction, and styled using **Bootstrap** for a clean and responsive UI.

## 🧠 Model Overview

The ML model is trained using historical agricultural data and predicts the yield of a crop using:

- Year  
- Average Rainfall (mm per year)  
- Pesticide Usage (tonnes)  
- Average Temperature (°C)  
- Area (Country)  
- Item (Crop Type)

## 🚀 Features

- Simple and interactive web UI
- Real-time predictions based on user inputs
- Built-in input validation (optional)
- Backend model powered by scikit-learn
- Local Flask server for fast prototyping
